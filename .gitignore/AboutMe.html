<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">About Me</h1>

<h1 style="font-family:verdana:">Likes and Dislikes</h2>
<p> When I have nothing to do I like to sleep or read. My favorite book is Unwind by Neal Shusterman and The Divergent Series. I usually read when I am home alone, it's nice and quite and I won't have any disturbance. I love The Fast and The Furious movies like all of them, my favorite one may be the first one because it is the one that started it all.  
  I may not have a dog but I love my cousins dog Sofia aka Chofis. </p>
