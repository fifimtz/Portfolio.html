<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Estephania Martinez and I am a 17 year old from Chicago, Illinois. I am the oldest of three and am in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, where I am currently learning how to code. In my family we are sort of weird in a way because we are all into cars and nothing else matters but "Familia" also known as Family. The cousins have Familia on their cars, which consists mostly of Honda civics or anything Honda, to show where they belong its almost like a gang but more as a crew. </p>
