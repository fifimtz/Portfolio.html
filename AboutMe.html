<h1 style="color:blue"> About Me </h1>
<p> My name is Estephania Martinez and I am a 17 year old from Chicago, Illinois. I am the oldest of three and currently in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, where I am currently learning how to code. I am currently a Launch U summer scholar also. </p>

<h1 id="demo" onmouseover="mouseOver()" onmouseout="mouseOut()">Likes and Dislikes</h1>

<script>
function mouseOver() {
    document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "green";
}

function mouseOut() {
    document.getElementById("demo").style.color = "black";
}
</script>


<p> When I have nothing to do I like to sleep or read. My favorite book is Unwind by Neal Shusterman and The Divergent Series.
  I usually read when I am home alone, it's nice and quite and I won't have any disturbance. I love The Fast and The Furious movies like all of them, my favorite one may be the first one because it is the one that started it all.  
  I may not have a dog but I love my cousins dog Sofia aka Chofis. </p>
